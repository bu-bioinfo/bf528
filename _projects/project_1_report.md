title: "Project 1: Genome Assembly Report"
layout: single
---

For the first project, please create a jupyter notebook and write a small
report that includes the following listed below:


# Methods 

Write a methods section that describes the pipeline that you created for this 
project. This should follow the conventions we discussed in lecture. This should
be a few paragraphs at most. 

# Results

Write a short results section that includes the following findings and visualizations:

1. Create a circos plot from the GFF file generated by Prokka
- Use the instructions found in the guide for [Using Conda with VSCode and Jupyter Notebooks]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/notebooks_computational_envs/)
- This plot will likely be unintelligble without modifying some of the visualization
parameters. You do **not** need to make this plot prettier, I am only asking you to
make sure that you can use VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, and a conda environment with
the correct software installed all together. 
- You can also choose to use a different style of Circos plot that only reports
certain features [Alternative Circos Plot](https://moshi4.github.io/pyCirclize/circos_plot/#3-mycoplasma-alvi)

2. Open the report generated by QUAST and report the following findings for the polished assembly:
- The genome fraction (%)
- The duplication ratio
- The # of misassemblies
- The # of mismatches per 100kbp
- The total length of the assembly
- The GC Content


3. Open the report generated by QUAST for the **unpolished** assembly:
- Note any differences from the above report


4. Open the report generated by BUSCO and report the following values:
- The string indicating the BUSCO results (e.g. C:89.0%[S:85.8%,D:3.2%],F:6.9%,M:4.1%,n:3023)
- Please read the documentation on BUSCO or the source publication and provide a
short 1 paragraph explanation of what BUSCO is doing and what the values in the
above string indicate about your assembly. We will discuss in class more about
what exactly it's doing. 
- Include the plot created by the BUSCO_PLOT process

5. Write a short paragraph comparing how successful you believe the experiment
was in generating a high quality assembly. Point to specific metrics in the
reports and findings above that support your conclusions. You may also compare
these findings to the reference assembly found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000172635.2/)

Keep this brief and concise. This section should be no more than 500 words.
