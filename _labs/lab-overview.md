Every friday, our class session will be an interactive lab. These labs will 
be exercises that we work on together that reinforce the skills and tools we 
will need to use in class for our projects. 

The very first lab is entirely focused on getting set up to work on our shared computing
cluster. The rest of the labs are centered around small, self-contained
bioinformatics problems that we will solve using all of the different tools
we will be using in the future. 

Early labs will focus more on technical skills and getting comfortable with the
SCC. Later labs will focus on additional biological analyses and exploring more 
complex bioinformatics concepts. 

# Lab Structure

Most labs will have an introductory, short lecture on some of the tools we will
be using. Then, you will need to accept the github classroom assignment for the
lab and clone the repo to your directory. You will be asked to work entirely
on the SCC in the repo you clone to your student directory (/projectnb/bf528/students/<your-bu-username>).

At the end of the lab, please push any changes you have made to your github
repo. We will not be grading the labs, but your pushed changes will reflect
your participation for the labs. 

The directions for each lab typically outline what we will cover together, and 
then individual tasks that you will need to complete. Myself and the TAs will
roam the room to help you with any issues you may have.
