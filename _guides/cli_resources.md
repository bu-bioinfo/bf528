# Command Line Interface Resources

This class has a few pre-requisites, but one of the more important subjects to
have some familiarity with is how to use a command line interface (CLI). 

If you have little programming or computer science experience, I recommend first
familiarizing yourself with the command line interface. Although we have a number
of tools at our disposal that perform some of the functionalities of a CLI, it
is still important to know some basic concepts like how to navigate the file system,
how to use basic commands, and how to use redirection operators.

Please note that the below resources are not exhaustive and there are many other
resources available online.
